I grew up in Menomonie, WI, a small semi-rural town in Wisconsin, 
where I spent a lot of time practicing saxophone, french horn 
and mellophone.  I also played tennis, competed in a variety of 
forensics speaking events and acted in a few plays.

After high school, I went to Carleton College, a small liberal arts college 
in Northfield, MN.  While at Carleton, I discovered cognitive science, 
computer science and Hash House Harriers, among other things.

Since graduating from college, I have studied <a href="{{ '/research/' | prepend: site.baseurl}}">a variety of subjects</a> as a 
graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University.  I'm particularly interested
in the conceptual and technical issues involved in the modeling of complex systems,
particularly social systems.


At various points in time, I've built some stuff, some of it potentially 
useful to others.  These are described <a href="{{ '/projects/' | prepend: site.baseurl}}">over here</a>, and mostly hosted on 
[github](http://www.github.com/jamiefolson/).
